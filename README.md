## 🚍 Capstone Project: PMPML Ridership Dashboard

As a culmination of this challenge, I built a **PMPML Ridership Dashboard** using **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Lottie animations**.

This dashboard analyzes dummy PMPML bus ridership data to uncover passenger trends, peak routes, boarding stations, fare collection, and more. It’s designed to show how data-driven insights can help enhance public transportation in Pune.

### ✨ Features
- Interactive filters for Year, Route, and Boarding Station.
- Tabs for Overview, Routes, Stations, Trends, Fare Collection, and full Documentation.
- Beautiful bus animation using Lottie.
- Custom CSS styling.
- Upload your own CSV file and explore!
