# 🐍 30 Days Python Challenge – Indian Data Club

Welcome to my journey through the **#30DaysOfPython Challenge** by [Indian Data Club](https://indiandataclub.com)!  
This repository is where I’ll be tracking and sharing my daily Python practice, and learnings — all in one place.

## About the Challenge

The goal of this 30-day challenge is to build a solid foundation in Python — from the basics to some advanced concepts — while sharing progress publicly to stay consistent and learn together.

## 📓 Notebook

All challenge questions, and code are updated daily in a single Jupyter Notebook file:
